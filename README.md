# Production Ready Python

Welcome to Production Ready Python. This book's focus is on the structure of large Python programs, commonly used language features and data structure libraries, and maintainable, testable and production ready code.

### Intended Audience

Python can be used for a large set of tasks, but this book specifically dives into writing code for a large codebase with multiple authors. The aim is to make you comfortable using Python for a day job with such a codebase, and for interviews that demand those skills. It's targeted towards learners who know basic Python - those who can already manipulate simple data structures like lists, and can write simple programs. 

**This book is not intended to be a good reference for data science/ML, so it won't dive into any data science specific concepts/modules, like `numpy` .**

### Material

Concepts covered

* Python 3.8
* Python code formatting and style guide
* Quick recap on data structures like `list`, `dict`, and `set` 
* The `collections` module and some commonly used data structures like `defaultdict`, `namedtuple` 
* Context managers
* File I/O. Reading and writing a common format like `JSON` 
* Exceptions. Best practices for handling exceptions in production code
* Testing via `pytest` . Best practices for writing tests, and appropriate use of `mock` and `mock.patch` 
* Scripting Concepts, like argument parsing
* `requests` for HTTP
* `pip` and `virtualenv` for external dependencies
* Code organization, Pythonic code, and conventions
* Typing in Python and Mypy

This book is heavily biased towards teaching concepts that we've seen commonly used in large Python codebases. For example, we've rarely seen use of functional operators like `map/reduce/filter`, so those will be omitted here. This will reduce superfluous material you need to learn.

Finally, we will give unique insights into the experience of maintaining large scale Python applications when relevant.

### Credits

We were inspired to write this book after the strong response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/hk9rw9/is_it_worth_creating_another_python_coursetutorial/) Reddit post and multiple requests for an "Intermediate Python" course.

Thanks to "[A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)" for introducing [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), which is a great medium to write an open source book.
