# Production Ready Python

Welcome to Production Ready Python. This book's focus is on the structure of large Python programs, commonly used language features and data structure libraries, and maintainable, testable and production ready code.

### Intended Audience

Python can be used for a large set of tasks, but this book specifically dives into writing code for a large codebase with multiple authors. The aim is to make you comfortable using Python for a day job with such a codebase, and for interviews that demand those skills. It's targeted towards learners who know basic Python - those who already can manipulate inbuilt data structures and write simple programs. 

**This book is not intended to be a good reference for data science/ML, so it won't dive into any data science specific concepts/modules, like `numpy` .**

### Material

Concepts covered

* Python 3.8
* Python code formatting and style guide
* Quick recap on data structures like `list`, `dict`, and `set` 
* The `collections` module and some commonly used data structures like `defaultdict`, `namedtuple` 
* Context managers
* File I/O. Reading and writing a common format like `JSON` 
* Exceptions. Best practices for handling exceptions in production code
* Testing via `pytest` . Best practices for writing tests, and correct use of `mock` and `mock.patch` 
* Python scripting - best practices

This book is heavily biased towards teaching concepts that I've seen commonly used in large Python codebases. For example, I've rarely seen use of the functional operators like `map/reduce/filter`, so those will be omitted here. In contrast, we'll go over iterators and generators. This will reduce superfluous material you need to learn.
