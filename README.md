# Welcome to Intermediate Python

Welcome to Intermediate Python. 

### Intended Audience

The aim of this opinionated course is to make you comfortable using Python for a day job and in interviews. It's targeted towards learners who know basic Python, like being able to manipulate inbuilt data structures and write simple programs. To that end, this course doesn't try to go too deep into any particular modules, rather, the goal is to teach you enough that you can be comfortable importing any module and using it.

This book is also heavily biased towards teaching concepts that I've seen commonly used in large Python codebases. For example, I've rarely seen use of the functional operators like `map/reduce/filter` in codebases, so those will be omitted here. In contrast, we'll go over iterators and generators. This will reduce superfluous material you need to learn in order to be productive in a large codebase.

This course also doesn't dive into any data science specific concepts/modules, like `numpy` .
